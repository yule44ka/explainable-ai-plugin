Problem statement:
pk setup for MTI to parent get confused by multiple OneToOne references.
Description
	
class Document(models.Model):
	pass
class Picking(Document):
	document_ptr = models.OneToOneField(Document, on_delete=models.CASCADE, parent_link=True, related_name='+')
	origin = models.OneToOneField(Document, related_name='picking', on_delete=models.PROTECT)
produces django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: Add parent_link=True to appname.Picking.origin.
class Picking(Document):
	origin = models.OneToOneField(Document, related_name='picking', on_delete=models.PROTECT)
	document_ptr = models.OneToOneField(Document, on_delete=models.CASCADE, parent_link=True, related_name='+')
Works
First issue is that order seems to matter?
Even if ordering is required "by design"(It shouldn't be we have explicit parent_link marker) shouldn't it look from top to bottom like it does with managers and other things?

Hints:
That seems to be a bug, managed to reproduce. Does the error go away if you add primary_key=True to document_ptr like I assume you wanted to do? This makes me realized that the ​MTI documentation is not completely correcy, ​the automatically added `place_ptr` field end up with `primary_key=True`. Not sure why we're not checking and field.remote_field.parent_link on ​parent links connection.
Replying to Simon Charette: It does go away primary_key. Why is parent_link even necessary in that case? Having pk OneToOne with to MTI child should imply it's parent link.
Replying to Mārtiņš Šulcs: Replying to Simon Charette: It does go away primary_key. Why is parent_link even necessary in that case? Having pk OneToOne with to MTI child should imply it's parent link. I have an update. The warning goes away with primary_key, but model itself is still broken(complains about document_ptr_id not populated) unless field order is correct.
Been able to replicate this bug with a simpler case: class Document(models.Model): pass class Picking(Document): some_unrelated_document = models.OneToOneField(Document, related_name='something', on_delete=models.PROTECT) Produces the same error against some_unrelated_document.
Hi, Could this approach be appropriate? parent_links's params can be base and related class instance therefore just last sample columns are added into parent_links. We can extend key logic with related_name, e.g ('app', 'document', 'picking'). Or using this method, we can always ensure that the parent_link=True field is guaranteed into self.parents. ​PR +++ b/django/db/models/base.py @@ -196,10 +196,11 @@ class ModelBase(type): if base != new_class and not base._meta.abstract: continue # Locate OneToOneField instances. - for field in base._meta.local_fields: - if isinstance(field, OneToOneField): - related = resolve_relation(new_class, field.remote_field.model) - parent_links[make_model_tuple(related)] = field + fields = [field for field in base._meta.local_fields if isinstance(field, OneToOneField)] + for field in sorted(fields, key=lambda x: x.remote_field.parent_link, reverse=True): + related_key = make_model_tuple(resolve_relation(new_class, field.remote_field.model)) + if related_key not in parent_links: + parent_links[related_key] = field # Track fields inherited from base models. inherited_attributes = set()
What's the status on this? I'm encountering the same issue.
